Homework for LAVC Co Sci 839 with Sefiani

Written by Sebastian Gonzalez, Spring 2019

Due to the lack of care in grading, I have done done little to no debugging for these programs. I do not guarantee that they work as expected. They compile without errors (although if you are in his class, at the time of writting this, he does not run the programs that are turned in).

For information on any of these programs, email: sebastian.codeinfo@gmail.com
